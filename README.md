I have a bachelor's and master's degree from the Institute of Information Technology of the Russian Technical University MIREA in software engineering.

The main technology stacks are Python + FastApi and now also Dart + Flutter.



## FAQ

#### Why does the app look simple enough?

This app was my first time implementing it in a programming language I wasn't accustomed to. I found Dart and Flutter quite appealing and user-friendly.

#### QWill the app be released on the phone?

I'm hoping to finish the desktop version of the app and start implementing it on the android. I have another project in the works that I'd like to implement, so this is a pet project.
